Consider a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) of microphones (sound sensors). Each microphone is omnidirectional
and identical, unless mentioned otherwise. Speed of sound is 340 m/s.

(a) Write a program to plot the directional gain of a 10-element ULA for the target frequency 2kHz. The
ULA has the inter-element distance equal to the half of the wavelength of the target signal. Submit
your code and plot. 
(b) Write a program and plot the directional gain of a 10-element ULA for the target frequency 2kHz.
The ULA has the inter-element distance equal to the twice of the wavelength of the target signal.
Submit your code and plot. 
(c) Point out the differences in the directional gains of the above two configurations of the array and
explain the reasons for the differences.
