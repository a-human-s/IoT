Task 1: Warming-up

Read the sound file and plot the signal.
(a) Read the sound signal with your program and store it in a variable. Find out the sample rate of the
recording. Play the file using an audio player and listen to the sound. 
(b) Plot the time domain signal. The vertical axis should show the amplitude and horizontal axis should
show time (NOT the sample numbers). Use proper labels and units for the axes.
(c) Plot the STFT or the spectrogram of the signal using a standard library function. For Matlab, you
can use the ‘spectrogram’ function. 


Task 2: Home-grown STFT

Plot STFT of the signal using your own DFT matrix. You can not use standard function to generate the
DFT matrix for this task. 
(a) Create a 1024 point DFT matrix. Plot the real and imaginary components of that matrix in two
separate 2-dimension image plots.
(b) Use your DFT matrix to find the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the signal. Here the timewindow
(or FFT-points, same as the number of rows/columns of the DFT matrix) should be 1024
and the time-windows should not have any overlap between them. Plot the STFT as a 2-dimensional
plot. The vertical axis should show frequency and horizontal axis should show time. Use proper tick
values and labels for the axes.
(c) Get the same STFT as in the previous question but using exactly one matrix multiplication. Plot the
real part of the matrix you used.
