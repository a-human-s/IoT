Consider a ULA of microphones (sound sensors) with 10 elements for the target frequency 2kHz. The
ULA has the inter-element distance equal to the half of the wavelength of the target signal. Speed of
sound is 340 m/s.

(a) The samples of the incoming signal from all the elements of the array at a given instance of time is provided. 
The data is in form of a complex vector. Plot the real and imaginary values of the array snapshot. The x-axis of the 
plot should be properly labeled with the element index. You can use ‘csvread’ Matlab function to read the array 
snapshot as a complex vector.

(b) Use the Fast Fourier Transform to find the direction of arrival (DoA) of the signal from the array
snapshot. (a) Report the DoA in degrees. (b) Plot the angular spectrum with x-axis properly labeled
with possible directions of arrival in degrees. The plot should show a clear peak at the estimated
DoA.

(c) Use the Delay-Sum method to find the direction of arrival (DoA) of the signal from the array snapshot.
(a) Report the DoA in degrees. (b) Plot the angular spectrum with x-axis properly labeled with
possible directions of arrival in degrees. The plot should show a clear peak at the estimated DoA.
(c) Submit your codes.
